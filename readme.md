Project made in unity engine version 2020.1.8f1.

To Open: download the entire code folder and open with unity engine. 
To Download Windows EXE: Download the Sling Arena.zip file and extract it to find the latest build.

Builds: All builds are either windows exe builds or IOS builds. EXE Builds are located in the "Builds" folder and IOS ones are located in the "IOS Builds" folder.

All packages should be included in the project files.

Assets include blender/fbx files and some probuilder ones aswell.

All enemies are stored in one folder in the assets section of the project files as well as all the map types so that they can be preocedurally loaded as the game goes on.
